### Serve
Another handy tool is [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve#readme). It's a dev server serving static files from some specified directory. Let's [add it to the scripts](package.json:). Here I point it at `build` folder which doesn't exist yet.

### Y no open HTML file?
Browsers apply [significant limitations](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/418238) for pages opened that way, e.g. AJAX calls would be problematic.

### Can I use serve in production?
When serving static content for real users, you'd better use something like [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/), designed for that purpose. Or just use PaaS like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (developers of `serve`, by the way) or [surge](https://surge.sh/), they will handle all configurations for you.
