### My first coding story!
Hello, colleagues! I consider coding stories an approach combining advantages of both slides approach and live coding: rich code display, focus on changes, well-prepared knowledge sharing structure.

Hence, I decided to create few, and even more in case of positive feedback, coding stories with some popular or unique web technologies.

### What's the idea behind the project?
It's gonna be merely a [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) to shuffle a set of strings. I use similar web services occasionally :-)

### Who is the author?
_In case anyone interested_, y name is Vitalii Perehonchuk, I'm a senior software engineer at [EPAM](https://www.epam.com/), and a coordinator of its JavaScript RD Lab in Vinnytsia. Feel free to connect to me at e.g. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitalii-perehonchuk-10570693/).
