### Init Yarn
Yarn is my package manager of choice (instead of NPM CLI), I suggest you use it when possible :-)

### Babel
First thing needed is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) ([core + CLI](package.json:4-5)), to transform modern fancy JS with classes, arrow functions and cool methods &mdash; into old good ES5 supported by absolute majority of browsers. _Note_: I prefer tilde (`~`) version notation to control dependencies' versions more accurately.

Also, for it to work [a script must be added](package.json:12) into `scripts` section of `package.json`.

Of course, `yarn install` must be run after new dependencies were added (don't forget to add `yarn.lock` file to your next commit).
