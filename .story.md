### PostCSS
Another interesting available tool is PostCSS. It's a CSS *post*processor. In this case it is used to apply autoprefixer to it &mdash; another tool which adds proprietarily-prefixed experimental properties as duplicates of fresh ones.

However, these days most browsers are up-to-date in terms of CSS, and you won't see much prefixes in your CSS bundles.
