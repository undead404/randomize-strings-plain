### Babel doesn't fit anymore
Problem is that Babel can't do anything more than transpile a set of files. Yes, it also can copy something, glue some files together, but what is needed is proper resolving of imports.

### Y no Webpack?
You'll probably see Webpack on most projects as universal (JS, HTML, CSS, SVG, images, etc) bundler. However, I'm developing this app naturally, and I don't think Webpack with its sophisticated configuration is the best option here.

### Parcel
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is a much more convenient alternative. First of all, [let's install it](package.json:5) (and remove redundant Babel packages: Parcel brings them under the hood). Also, we remove Serve as Parcel will serve (pardon!) as its replacement as well.

Besides that, [.parcelrc](.parcelrc) file must be added. I use default Parcel config here. Also, `babel.config.json` usage is not recommended with Parcel; it's also removed.

Another important part is `scripts`. [rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf) is added as Parcel can't remove build folder by itself.

To summarize, _*Bonuses from Parcel*_:
1. Hot module reload for development
2. JS and CSS bundles are automatically injected into HTML
3. [Source maps](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)
4. Built-in dev server
