### Babel configuration
For Babel to transpile anything, a configuration file must be added, e.g. [babel.config.json](babel.config.json). This particular config requires two more libraries to be added to `devDependencies`: [@babel/preset-env](package.json:7) (reads information about target environments and make Babel transpile code accordingly) and [core-js](package.json:4) (provides polyfills for various JavaScript features which may be missing in outdated browsers).

### browserslist
`browserslist` is a library used by `@babel/preset-env` under the hood to determine target environments. For it to work, a config file called [.browserslistrc](.browserslistrc) must be added to the root of the project. This particular config will target last versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera, and also IE11 plus many mobile browsers, including Opera Mini.
