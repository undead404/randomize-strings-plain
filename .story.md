### Error handling
Something can go wrong, and how do we see that? That's why error handling is necessary. When a user encounters your app's failure, he or she must see a notification, not bump into white wall of death or just a button being dead.

Hence, let's [add that catch block](src/index.js:24). Besides that, let's [remove all error messages](src/index.js:9) in case of success.

Also, [some css](src/styles.css:25) would be helpful.
