### What are technologies for this project?
This project is planned to be dead simple, in terms of dependencies. However, there are quite a few limitations I would like to apply to make my experience more comfortable:
1. Modern JavaScript, hence &mdash; transpilation with Babel.
2. Ol' good HTML.
3. A bit of CSS!
4. No turducken code: separate JS files, separate HTML, separate CSS.

### Y no React/Angular/Vue/Svelte/etc?
We abuse rich front-end frameworks these days. Web technologies were made to be used as-is. Also, I'd like to show front-end beginners the basics of what we have. Sometimes we have only minimum of tools, and may be efficient.
