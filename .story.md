### api.random.org
Who would I be if you would not oversophisticate this?

[random.org] is a service listening to atmospheric noises with a set of radios and providing random values based on that noise. `Math.random` provides only *pseudo*random values, you know? Let's use random.org's API.

First of all, let's [install and import](package.json:4) `axios` - my favourite AJAX library.

Then, sign up for random.org account and request an API key; then create `.env` file based on [.env.example](.env.example:1) (I can not share my API key with you).

At third, [request api.random.org](src/shuffle-with-random.js:12) &mdash; their `generateIntegers` method. Their API follows [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC) approach instead of REST or GraphQL.

At fourth, let's [rewrite button click handler into an async one](src/index.js:15). Voila!
